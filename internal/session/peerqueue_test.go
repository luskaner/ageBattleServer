// WHAT THIS FILE IS
//
// The other half of formula (2) in peersweep_test.go, and the half with no
// ceiling: the frame store is bounded per SESSION (one ceil of blocks for the
// whole session), while each peer's pending upload queue is bounded per PEER and
// **nothing bounds the sum**. So the worst-case footprint of a session is the
// sum of its per-peer caps, and the only way to know it is to saturate them.
//
//	entry count >= 0x12C (300)     the peer has 300 chunks
//	queued bytes >= 0x80000 (512 KiB)
//
// Both are the peer's own record: 40 bytes holding {begin, end, capacity} of the
// chunks, a u32 byte counter and the peer id, pushed
// when the peer joins and erased when it disconnects, and the erasure destroys
// whatever the peer had uploaded and not yet been flushed.
//
// ack_test.go already covers the cap's MECHANICS on a bare AckState with one or
// two slots. What is asked here, and was never asked, is what a session full of
// peers that all hit the cap costs, and whether the cap holds when a peer keeps
// uploading past it.
//
// The byte counter charges the payload alone, the client's chunk minus its u16
// length (chunkCharge), while the queued sub is [slot][len u16][payload]. A sub is
// a pooled buffer with a floor of 256 bytes (ack.go, subPool.New), so a small
// chunk costs 256 bytes of real memory while charging 62. That is why the REAL
// per-peer figure below is four times the charged one, and why the queue is
// asserted on both.
//
// A tick takes at most ackDrainPasses chunks from a peer and at most ackMaxSubs
// into one 0x0A, so a saturated queue drains over several ticks, not one.
