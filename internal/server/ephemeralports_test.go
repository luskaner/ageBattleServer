// WHAT THIS FILE IS
//
// Config.EphemeralListenPorts and Server.BoundPorts exist for one caller:
// internal/sim, which starts a real server for every capture replay and cannot
// use the recorded ports. It used to pick them by binding :0, reading the port
// and letting go, and asking the server to bind that number later. That leaves
// the port owned by nobody in between, and a listener bind on Windows is
// exclusive, so anything that takes it in that window makes Start fail and the
// replay dies with "start server: ... bind". Measured on this machine: 1 in 8
// runs of `go test -short ./internal/sim` under load (SESSION-JOURNAL.md 38).
//
// The fix is to ask at bind time and read the answer back, so these three things
// have to be true and are asserted here:
//
//   - a server asked for OS-assigned ports really binds two DIFFERENT ones, and
//     BoundPorts names them;
//   - BoundPorts is the port that is listening, not the configured one: a caller
//     that dials it has to reach the transport;
//   - asking for an OS-assigned port on ONE transport does not switch the other
//     one on, because a test that exercises only the WebSocket listener must not
//     silently acquire a bs listener.
//
// It is also where the pick-a-port helper this package used to have is gone from:
// nothing in internal/server asks the OS for a port and lets it go, and the only
// test below that still names a port of its own says why in its own comment.
//
// The inventory of that shape over the whole module, so the next reader does not
// have to grep for it. Four places bind and KEEP: internal/net's own listener
// (tcp.go:63), the bs listener, the WebSocket listener (ws_listener.go:176) and
// the proxy's (cmd/proxy/tcp_proxy.go:389), and every one of them reports what it
// got. Two places cannot keep it and say so: the proxy's TestWaitForPortGivesUp,
// which needs a port nothing is listening on, and its
// TestClientPortIsTheConfiguredOneWhenThereIsOne, whose claim IS about a
// configured number. Both go through takeUnusedPort (cmd/proxy/
// process_manager_test.go), which checks the port and retries with a written cap
// instead of handing over a number it did not verify. One test binds a literal,
// port 23012, and says why: nothing that asks the OS for a port can be handed it.
// The integration tests ask for OS-assigned ports, the out-of-band one included.
// And that is the whole list; no production code picks a port by binding and
// letting go.
//
// The falsification is in the git history of this file's own comment: put
// EphemeralListenPorts back to "not read" in New and the ports read 0, and put
// it back to "one switch for both" and the WebSocket-only server grows a bs
// listener.

// TestEphemeralListenPortsBindTwoDistinctPorts is the whole claim. The ports
// come from the OS, so the two numbers must be real, must not be the configured
// ones (which are 0 here) and must not collide with each other: two transports on
// one port is a server whose second listener failed.
