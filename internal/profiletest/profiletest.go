// Package profiletest reads the sample count out of a pprof profile.
//
// It exists because two packages in this repo take CPU profiles of themselves and
// both have to answer the same question before they may report anything: does the
// file carry samples, or is it an empty window with a beautiful top-10 waiting to be
// read out of it? A count is a counter and can be asserted; "have a look at the
// profile" cannot.
//
// The alternative to this package is shelling out to `go tool pprof` from a test,
// which depends on that tool's text output staying the same across Go releases, or
// counting Sample records, which is not the same number (see SampleCount).

// SampleCount is the number of CPU samples in a pprof CPU profile.
//
// Four things about the format make this necessary rather than convenient, and all
// four were got wrong first, so they are written down here once instead of twice:
//
//   - Go 1.27 GZIPS what pprof.StartCPUProfile and Lookup("heap").WriteTo produce.
//     The file starts with 1f 8b, so a parser that reads the bytes as protobuf
//     counts zero samples in a file `go tool pprof` reports as full. Measured on
//     this machine: 0 against 958.
//   - Sample is field 2 of Profile, not field 1 (field 1 is sample_type). Counting
//     field 1 counts the two value types.
//   - The number of Sample RECORDS is not the number of samples. Go coalesces
//     identical stacks inside one profiling cycle, so a window can carry fewer
//     records than ticks: measured 678 records carrying 958 samples.
//   - So the count has to come out of the values, and it has to be the FIRST of the
//     two: Go writes value = [samples, cpu-nanoseconds], and the second of those is
//     958 million on the same window, not 958.
//
// It is checked against `go tool pprof -sample_index=samples` on six real profiles
// in SESSION-JOURNAL.md 39, where the two agree exactly. That cross-check is what
// makes this worth having: an earlier version of this walker skipped an unknown
// field by moving on one byte instead of consuming its payload, which
// desynchronised it and counted MORE rather than failing loudly (1192 against
// pprof's 1076), and nothing but the comparison would have caught it.
