// The settle window decides how much of the match the replay gets to read, and
// reading less of it than the recording holds is indistinguishable, in the
// report, from the server having said less. That is what these tests are about:
// each one is a shape of capture whose settle used to be wrong in a way that
// produced a divergence the server did not have.

// settleBase is the base settleForTruth takes as its input in the tests below: three
// periods, floored at 400 ms, which is what settleFor returned before the observer
// step's period became part of it. settleForTruth is a pure function of that base, so
// the tests that exercise the WIDENING pass a base that is genuinely shorter than the
// whole second they need to reach -- which is the situation the bsPort capture is in.

// TestTheSettleCoversTheObserverStep is the arithmetic, and it is the whole fix. The
// observer step is a PHASE: its cursor takes interval+1 values, wrapping only
// when it is strictly greater than the interval, and the entry at index 0 is
// served on the ticks where it is 0. So an observer that activates just after a
// tick waits up to interval+1 ticks, which is the bound internal/session's
// TestTheWorstPhaseCostsTheWholePeriod measures, and the settle has to be at
// least that plus the tick the write happens on.
//
// The number is not read out of this file: it comes from the server's own
// ObserverUpdateIntervalTicks, which is the same function the session is configured
// with. A settle derived from a copy of that number would be a settle that could
// disagree with the step it is waiting for, which is the defect itself.
