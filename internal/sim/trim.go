// A trimmed capture: the same run, with most of its wall clock cut off.
//
// Every capture here is replayed in REAL TIME, on purpose, because the server emits
// 0x0A per simulation tick and not per input: feeding a capture faster leaves the
// server less wall-clock time to produce the output the comparison is about
// (Options.ReplaySpeed). The price of that decision is that a test costs what the
// recorded run cost, so the 14 minute capture is a 14 minute test and the 24 minute
// one does not fit in any budget. The only way out that does not falsify the
// comparison is to make the DATA shorter. This file is that: it keeps the first
// seconds of a capture and drops the rest of the clock, changing nothing else.
//
// What makes a crop checkable is that the truth is a recording. The harness compares
// our server against what the ORIGINAL answered to the same bytes, and those bytes
// are on disk, so a crop either leaves a prefix of them (nothing observable was
// lost) or it does not (and CheckTrim says so). Nothing here decides that: the
// verdicts are computed by replaying both captures, in CheckTrim, from the same
// rules every other capture goes through.
//
// # What is never cut
//
// The handshake and the control answers (0x19, 0x1E) are inside the kept window by
// construction: they are what a capture is usually taken for, and the crop point is
// chosen after the last one. The observer's replay window start is not something the
// crop can move, because the window starts at the first retained frame of the store
// and the frames before the cut are untouched. The order of the sub-messages and of
// the checksum entries cannot move either, for the same reason: they are sequences,
// and a suffix is removed, never a middle. Every one of those four claims is
// asserted by CheckTrim rather than repeated here.

// formatVersionTrimmed is the metadata version of a capture that has been cropped.
// Version 1 is what cmd/proxy writes and version 2 is the same document plus the
// trim record, which is what says the window is not the whole run. Load accepts
// both, and refuses a version 2 with no trim record: a capture that claims to be
// cropped without saying what was cut is a capture nobody can audit.

// TrimRecord is what a trimmed capture carries in its metadata.json. It is written
// by the tool that cropped the capture and read back by the harness, which prints it
