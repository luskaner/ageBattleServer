// Package sim replays a capture against this server and diffs what comes back
// against what the original answered to the same bytes.
//
// One capture directory is one test, and the test encodes nothing about the
// capture: it hands the directory to Run and Run decides what to compare.
// Adding a capture is adding a directory, never editing this package.
//
// # What the truth is
//
// The truth is always the original's traffic. Which of the two logs is the
// original is decided by metadata.json's writer field, never by the file name:
// main.log and secondary.log are fixed names (cmd/proxy/capture.go:12) and the
// two binaries have been swapped from run to run, which is exactly what
// produced three wrong conclusions about the StartObserve status byte
// (SESSION-JOURNAL.md, "Capture identity"). A capture whose sides are
// not identified has no truth to compare against, and it is refused rather than
// passed, because a tri-state that collapses to "fine" hides the one fact that
// makes the capture useless.
//
// # Two verdict levels
//
// must-match is what the client depends on. If it changes, the game breaks:
//
//   - the 0x19 StartObserveResponse status byte
//   - whether a 0x1E ActivateObserverResponse arrives
//   - the replay stream the observer is served: which point of the match its
//     first 0x0A frame is, and the order of the frames. The stream is the
//     session's own 0x0A acks, because that is what the frame store holds
//     (it is fed the ack the tick just built); an earlier revision read 0x09 here,
//     which no observer is ever sent, so the rule compared nothing.
//
// Everything else is informative: recorded, printed, and never fatal. The
// original has quirks of its own (CAPTURES.md row 8: 2 of 26 LOBBYPING answered
// in _26), and a test that fails on those ends up switched off entirely, which
// costs more than the divergence it reported.
//
// # When
//
// Every finding about a message carries the moment it happened, on both sides,
// counted from the first message the client sent. That is what separates a
// difference produced during the match from one produced while the harness was
// still reading after the last input, and a total cannot: "we sent eleven more"
// reads the same either way. The [message-tail] rule is where the two are
// decided, and the decision is computed from the two streams' own timestamps so
// it cannot say the opposite of what the numbers say. See when.go for the axis,
// its two different precisions, and why nothing is located by aligning streams
// that are hundreds of identical acks long.
//
// # What is not compared
//
// Only what is ours to decide. Timestamps, socket ports and clock-derived
// fields are masked before the comparison; the masked fields are listed in the
// report so the list itself stays auditable. The ports of the replay are
// necessarily different (the capture's ports belong to the run that produced
// it), and every field the harness changes on purpose is reported as a
// deviation with its reason.

//  1. An HTTP upgrade on the connection. stripHandshake removes it before this is

//  2. The bytes themselves, and the whole of them. Two bytes are not enough: an
//     RLink message is [u16 BE length][type][body], so a message of 33024..33279
//     or 33536..34047 bytes begins 0x81 or 0x82, which is byte for byte what a

//     and the one that reads without meeting a byte that cannot start a frame is
//     the one taken. It is the same walk scan() does, without building messages.

// does, the connection is not the battle protocol and says so, which is what an
