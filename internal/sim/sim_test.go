// The synthetic capture.
//
// No capture survives in the repository (the historical thirty were deleted,
// SESSION-JOURNAL.md "discards from the history"), and the harness still has to be
// verifiable today. So the fixture below builds one, in the exact format the
// proxy writes, and encodes the observer handshake the decompilation and the
// historical captures agree on:
//
//	player   (bsPort, length-prefixed frames):  LobbyConnect 0x15, then three
//	         replay pages 0x09 with inner type 0xFE
//	observer (webSocketPort, WebSocket frames): StartObserve 0x1C, then
//	         ActivateObserver 0x1A
//	original's answers: 0x19 status 0, 0x1E status 0, then the retained page
//	         window in order, then 0x22
//
// Three pages with -maxPagesToStorePerSession 2 is what makes the observer
// admissible: the original's frame store is always finite, of size
// ceil(peers * f) with peers floored at 8, and StartObserve refuses while the
// first retained frame is still 0. _26 answered 0 and served 7343 pages; _30
// answered 3, the client never sent ActivateObserver and reported the start of
// the match gone. The fixture is the _26 shape.
//
// What is hand-written here is only the ORIGINAL's side, and only the parts the
// three must-match rules read. The 0x0A heartbeat in it is a stand-in: the real
// server emits one ack per simulation tick and the fixture writes one, so that
// difference is reported as informative, which is the point of having two
// verdict levels.

// `01 02 00 aa 01`, and the ack that flushes it alone ends `00 00 00`: no pending
// peer, and a block of length zero.
//
// An earlier revision of these three bodies wrote the sub length big-endian and

//
//   - there IS a tail finding, and it reaches one of the two conclusions;

//     to be three views of the same numbers.
//   - the OBSERVER connection is the settle one. That half is structural and not
//     luck: the fixture feeds its whole handshake at t=1s, which is where the
//     window opens, so no answer to it can arrive before the window.
//
// What is NOT checked here is which conclusion the PLAYER connection reaches. It used
// to be required to be "interleaved", and that assertion was a flake measured at 1 in

// window than the original had, our server emits one ack per simulation tick and the

// of our eight 125 ms ticks to land inside the first wall-clock second. That is how
// many ticks the host's scheduler managed, which is not a property of the protocol and
// not something a test may assert. Widening a tolerance would not fix it either: the
// number is not near a boundary, it is a count of ticks.
